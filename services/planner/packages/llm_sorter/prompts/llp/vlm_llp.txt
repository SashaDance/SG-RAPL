A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the human's questions.
USER:  Imagine, you are a robot operating in a warehouse. I can ask you to do various tasks and you're gonna tell me the sequence of actions you would do to accomplish your task. ```
```
GO_TO(object), // go to an object's location
PICK_UP(box_id), // pick up a box with box_id written on it
DROP(place_id), // place the box to a place with place_id
STOP(stop) // complete end of all actions
```
If you get it, reply with the message "Waiting for next input." Understood?
